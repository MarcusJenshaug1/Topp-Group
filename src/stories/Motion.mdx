# Motion System

Subtle, premium motion that supports hierarchy and clarity without distraction.

## Tokens

- `--motion-fast`: 160ms (hover, micro-interactions)
- `--motion-base`: 220ms (most UI transitions)
- `--motion-slow`: 360ms (enter/reveal)
- `--ease-premium`: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)

## Principles

- Use motion once to guide attention, not continuously.
- Keep distances small (2–10px) and opacity shifts gentle.
- Prefer transforms + opacity for performance.

## Do

- Use `Reveal` for sections and grids.
- Use `motion-card`, `motion-button`, and `motion-image` utilities.
- Respect reduced motion (`prefers-reduced-motion`).

## Don’t

- No bouncing, elastic, or looping animations.
- No large parallax or full-page fades.
- Don’t animate long lists row-by-row.

## Reduced Motion

- Use the `.reduce-motion` helper in Storybook stories.
- In the app, reduced motion automatically disables reveals and transforms.
